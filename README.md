# genasys-demo

This is just a slightly cleaned up demo of the new index page for Genasys.

DISCLAIMER:
==========
NONE OF THE HIDEOS, HORRIBLE, CONVOLUTED OR SHIT CODE BELONGS TO OR IS ASSOCIATED WITH ME IN ANY FORM WHATSOVER.

WHOEVER MADE 99.9% OF THIS SITE SHOULD BE SHOT ON SIGHT.

That said, the content of the new index that you see and 99% of the styling is all mine (EXCEPT THE HORRIBLE DISPICABLE CODE THAT WAS SUMMONED FROM THE DEPTHS OF HELL, THAT GARBAGE ISN'T MINE).
